# Information Security Policy

We believe in a digital world built on freedom, responsibility, and integrity.

Cybersecurity is not just about defense — it’s about mutual respect. It’s about striving to do your best that every interaction, every line of code, and every user experience reflects a commitment to doing right things, not just the right things.
