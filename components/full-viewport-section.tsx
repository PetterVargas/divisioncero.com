// layout-effect below computes, instead of starting taller and visibly
// shrinking into place once JS runs (that mismatch was making the
// already-shifted hero text appear to "jump" into its final position on
// load). Returning visitors who dismissed the banner will still see a
// small one-time correction, since its height then collapses to 0.

 * plain `min-h-screen` here would stack on top of the banner/nav and push
 * the hero content below the first screen instead of filling it.
